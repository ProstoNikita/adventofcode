## --- Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard ---
Because your neighbors keep defeating you in the holiday house decorating contest year after year, you've decided to deploy one million lights in a 1000x1000 grid.

Furthermore, because you've been especially nice this year, Santa has mailed you instructions on how to display the ideal lighting configuration.

Lights in your grid are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction; the lights at each corner are at <code>0,0</code>, <code>0,999</code>, <code>999,999</code>, and <code>999,0</code>. The instructions include whether to <code>turn on</code>, <code>turn off</code>, or <code>toggle</code> various inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs.  Each coordinate pair represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate pair like <code>0,0 through 2,2</code> therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square.  The lights all start turned off.
