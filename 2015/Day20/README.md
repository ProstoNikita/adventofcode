## --- Day 20: Infinite Elves and Infinite Houses ---
To keep the Elves busy, Santa has them deliver some presents by hand, door-to-door.  He sends them down a street with infinite houses numbered sequentially: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and so on.

Each Elf is assigned a number, too, and delivers presents to houses based on that number:


 - The first Elf (number <code>1</code>) delivers presents to every house: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, ....
 - The second Elf (number <code>2</code>) delivers presents to every second house: <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>8</code>, <code>10</code>, ....
 - Elf number <code>3</code> delivers presents to every third house: <code>3</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>9</code>, <code>12</code>, <code>15</code>, ....
