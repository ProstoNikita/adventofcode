## --- Day 16: Aunt Sue ---
Your Aunt Sue has given you a wonderful gift, and you'd like to send her a thank you card.  However, there's a small problem: she signed it "From, Aunt Sue".

You have 500 Aunts named "Sue".

So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure out which Aunt Sue (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity) gave you the gift.  You open the present and, as luck would have it, good ol' Aunt Sue got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine!  Just what you wanted.  Or needed, as the case may be.
