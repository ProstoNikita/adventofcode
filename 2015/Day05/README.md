## --- Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This? ---
Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.

A <em>nice string</em> is one with all of the following properties:


 - It contains at least three vowels (<code>aeiou</code> only), like <code>aei</code>, <code>xazegov</code>, or <code>aeiouaeiouaeiou</code>.
 - It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like <code>xx</code>, <code>abcdde</code> (<code>dd</code>), or <code>aabbccdd</code> (<code>aa</code>, <code>bb</code>, <code>cc</code>, or <code>dd</code>).
 - It does <em>not</em> contain the strings <code>ab</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>pq</code>, or <code>xy</code>, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.
